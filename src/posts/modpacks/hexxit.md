Reminisce the feeling of exploring (and fearing) the world of Minecraft with your friends? Hexxit Updated consists of not only mods from the original Hexxit, but re-imagined with numerous dimensions and dungeons to satiate the feelings of wanderlust. This modpack revolves around the nostalgia of Hexxit, but Hexxit Updated's true colours will reveal itself to travellers whom are willing to discover the world for themselves, as there is no story ingrained into Hexxit.
